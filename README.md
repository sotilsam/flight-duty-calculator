# ✈ Flight Duty & Payload Calculation Tool

Internal operational web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

This tool automates complex duty and payload calculations for airline staff, replacing repetitive manual processes with structured rule-based logic.

---

## 📌 Overview

Operational teams were required to manually calculate duty limits, fuel constraints, and time-based cutoffs according to internal regulatory rules.

The process was:

- Manual  
- Error-prone  
- Time-consuming  
- Frequently avoided due to complexity  

This application digitizes and automates that workflow.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated rule-based duty calculations  
- Payload calculation module  
- Fuel calculation module  
- Explanation view for rule transparency  
- Dynamic increment and decrement controls  
- Modular navigation layout
